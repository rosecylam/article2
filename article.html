				If you get it right, typography can be incredibly powerful. Turn to the writings of Robert Bringhurst, whose Elements of Typographic Style has served as a sagely reference text for decades, and you’ll find a high-minded articulation of the craft.
			</p>

			<p class="text highlight">Typography “exists to honor content,” according to Bringhurst, and when it’s done well it “reveals every element, every relationship between elements, and every logical nuance of the text.”</p>

			<p class="text">
				Whether you find these words inspiring or intimidating, the plain fact is that the right typographic choice always reflects the specific needs of the project itself. These needs are not only aesthetic, but also technical and functional—and there’s only so much you can tell from snippets of text as you scroll through a dropdown menu from Alegreya to Zapf Dingbats. Certain fonts work best in headlines, while others read well in paragraphs. Some font families are large enough to include international scripts and special characters. And if the font comes in a range of different styles (like italics or small caps) and weights (from hairline to ultra-black), it’ll offer more tools to fine-tune the design as the project comes together.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				There’s a lot to think about, sure, but some of the most important considerations are the practical and functional features of the project. By starting with what you already know, then thinking through the following considerations, you’ll find a font that meets your needs.
			</p>

			<a name="start"></a>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Start with your project’s scope</h2>
			</div>

			<p class="text">
				Are you starting something that could go on for a few months or even years, like a magazine, or is it a one-off project, like a slide deck, logo, or presentation?
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Chances are that a large, long-term project (like a periodical or newsletter) will have a variety of different typographic needs over time. Your best bet for covering those different needs is to choose a large type family that includes a variety of weights, styles, and variants like small caps and ligatures. Large families make branding easier because sticking to a single font over time ensures that you'll be able to handle different situations without having to add another font into the mix. Try these examples: Alegreya, Alegreya SC, Merriweather, Merriweather Sans, Roboto, Roboto Condensed, Work Sans.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				But if this is a short-term project (like a poster, album cover, or logo) you might not need extra weights, or the condensed and extended versions of a font. You could even choose a font with a single weight if you think it’s right for this particular task. Just bear in mind that the versatility of a large type family could still be useful as you make fine adjustments to the text in a short-run project. Try these examples: Bubblegum Sans, Graduate, Scope One, Space Mono.
			</p>

			<a name="say"></a>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>What do you want your font to say?</h2>
			</div>

			<p class="text">
				While the scope of your project could narrow your search by ruling out fonts that don’t have the range you need, or guiding you toward those that do, remember that there are no hard and fast rules to determine the font with the right aesthetic. That’s a matter of the font’s personality, but to some extent personality depends on familiarity.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Many apps and websites still use a small selection of the most common fonts—a holdover from a time when this was the most practical approach to digital typography.
			</p>

			<p class="text highlight">It was once the case that using system fonts would be the safest choice because you could count on them to be in working order and available across most devices. Today, there’s no need to compromise by selecting a commonplace ‘workhorse’ font.</p>

			<p class="text">
				Web fonts tend to be just as reliable as system fonts, but with a greater variety to choose from. Try these examples: Proxima Nova, Helvetica, Museo, Futura, Brandon Grotesque (popular); Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Helvetica, Times, Courier, Verdana, Georgia (system); Gibson, Gotham, Classic Grotesque, Montserrat (web fonts).
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				But if you’re still keen on finding an uncommon font to help your project stand out, there are dozens of commercial type foundries that sell proprietary fonts for either a flat fee or monthly rate. If you want a totally unique, bespoke typeface—and who wouldn’t—it can be expensive and time consuming, so start by reaching out to foundries for quotes. On the bright side, whomever you hire will probably handle many of the concerns listed in this guide. Among your free options, you could always look for a less commonly used web font. As a general rule, choosing a newer release means it won’t be in widespread use—at least not yet. We’re of course partial to Google Fonts. Take a spin through the directory to get a sense of just how many free web fonts are out there, and use the family specimen pages to view the amount of each font’s usage across the web.

			<div class="section">
				<h2>How much text are you typesetting?</h2>
			</div>

			<p class="text highlight">
				“Designers provide ways into—and out of—the flood of words,” writes design critic Ellen Lupton, “by breaking up text into pieces and offering shortcuts and alternate routes through masses of information.”
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Beyond the personality of your font choice, well-designed layouts also use visual cues, regularity, and variation to guide readers naturally. And choosing type according to the length of the text can give readers lots of cues and shortcuts to help with navigation.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				For headlines and subheads, you can choose an expressive, unique, even idiosyncratic font—including Display, Decorative, Handwritten, and Script styles. These unconventional, high contrast designs tend to work well in this context because their details and visual complexity help to attract the eye. If you’d like to use a sans serif font for short bits of text, especially in large sizes, the regular weight tends to look a little out of place. Consider using the bold and compressed styles instead. If you prefer serifs, hairline serif fonts like Playfair Display or Rufina tend to work well in short lines because their high stroke contrast tends to grab the reader’s attention.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Medium-length text, defined loosely as three to four paragraphs, is actually pretty flexible which means you've got options. If you’re leaning toward a serif font, opt for something in the old style like Quattrocento, a transitional style like Libre Baskerville, or a slab serif like Arvo. Prefer a sans serif? Then the best choice would be something in the humanist or grotesque style like Cabin or Raleway, but even some geometric styles like Montserrat will work. Experiment by trying out a few of these and see what works best in layout.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				When typesetting longer sections of text—exceeding five paragraphs—a serif typeface is recommended. This is the traditional choice for book typography, but it also works well on-screen. Old Style or Transitional serif fonts like EB Garamond or Libre Baskerville, tend to be easy on the eyes for longer reading like news and magazine articles. While it’s possible to use a Humanist sans serif font for long stretches of body text, the safer bet is a familiar serif design that readers can process quickly.
			</p>

			<div class="section">
				<h2>Still undecided?</h2>
			</div>

			<p class="text">
				It’s worth making a short list and getting to know the fonts you’re considering. Review the full range of characters and styles for each option. Check out how they look in Cyrillic or Thai. Find a bio for the designer, and see how this font has been used in the past. Above all, you don’t want to underestimate your typographic needs or the needs of your readers. The more styles, characters, and scripts a font supports, the better prepared you’ll be.
			</p>

			<p class="text">
				Typography is a subtle art, but less elusive than its reputation might suggest. If you’ve already given some thought to the organization of your project, its scope, and its audience, you’re primed to make smart typographic choices.
